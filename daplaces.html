                  The Forest Research Institute is a magnificent colonial
                  structure spread across 450 hectares. Established in 1906,
                  this British-era building features stunning Greco-Roman
                  architecture and houses six museums dedicated to forestry. The
                  institute is surrounded by well-manicured lawns and is a
                  popular spot for morning walks, photoshoots, and educational
                  tours. The museums showcase various aspects of forestry,
                  including pathology, social forestry, and timber.

                <p class="place-description">
                  Located 8 km from the city center, Robber's Cave is a unique
                  600-meter-long cave formation where a stream disappears and
                  reappears at different points. This natural wonder features
                  cold water springs and small waterfalls, making it a popular
                  spot for adventure enthusiasts. The cave got its name from the
                  British era when it was allegedly used by robbers as a
                  hideout. Today, it's a perfect destination for nature lovers
                  and photographers.

                  Known as 'Thousand Fold Spring', Sahastradhara is famous for
                  its sulphur water springs with medicinal properties. The water
                  drips from limestone stalactites, creating a spectacular
                  cave-like formation. Located 14 km from Dehradun, this spot
                  offers cable car rides, cave exploration, and therapeutic
                  bathing. The surrounding mountains and valleys make it a
